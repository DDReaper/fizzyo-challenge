# Cystic Fibrosis 101

5 babies are born with cystic fibrosis each week in the UK.

2 lives are lost every week in the UK to the condition.

1 in 25 of us carries the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis, most without knowing it.

If two carriers have a child, there is a 1 in 4 chance their baby will be born with cystic fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that kills thousands worldwide and is carried
unknowingly in the genes of millions. It is caused by a single defective gene, and slowly destroys the
lungs and digestive system. There are nearly 10,000 people with cystic fibrosis in the UK. Only half
will live to celebrate their 40th birthday.

Most people with cystic fibrosis look perfectly healthy, but it is a lifelong challenge involving vast
daily intakes of drugs, time-consuming physiotherapy, and isolation from others with condition, just to
stay healthy.

Fighting it is a battle we must win. That’s why we are working for and fundraising for change. It’s why
we must develop better treatments and, ultimately, a cure. Because cystic fibrosis is beatable.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic condition that slowly destroys the lungs and digestive
system. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust is the only UK-wide charity fighting for a life unlimited, when
everyone living with CF can look forward to a long, healthy life.

## Cross-infection policy

Cross-infection poses a particular threat to people with cystic fibrosis, so they should never meet each
other in person. The following policy lays out the rules for people with cystic fibrosis attending the hackathon.
